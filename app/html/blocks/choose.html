        <p class="choose__desc">
          Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
          challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end
          of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
          developing.

          The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information
          in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a
          large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into
          consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in
          different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices
          (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

        <p class="choose__desc">
          Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases, scripting, website
          architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any action on a website. It
          can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code written by back-end developers helps
          browsers to communicate with database information.

        <p class="choose__desc">
          First things first: UX and UI design are two different elements of a single consumer experience. UX refers to
          the user experience, which focuses on how something works and how people interact with it. UI, or user
          interface, focuses on the look and layout.

          An athlete (also sportsman or sportswoman) is a person who competes in one or more sports that involve
          physical strength, speed or endurance. The use of the term in several sports, such as golf or auto racing,
          becomes a controversial issue.

          Athletes may be professionals or amateurs.[1] Most professional athletes have particularly well-developed
          physiques obtained by extensive physical training and strict exercise accompanied by a strict dietary regimen.
